## API Documentation

To view the list of available APIs and their specifications, run the server and go to `http://localhost:3000/v1/docs` in your browser. This documentation page is automatically generated using the [swagger](https://swagger.io/) definitions written as comments in the route files.

## Linting

Linting is done using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).

In this app, ESLint is configured to follow the [Airbnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) with some modifications. It also extends [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) to turn off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

To modify the ESLint configuration, update the `.eslintrc.json` file. To modify the Prettier configuration, update the `.prettierrc.json` file.

To prevent a certain file or directory from being linted, add it to `.eslintignore` and `.prettierignore`.

To maintain a consistent coding style across different IDEs, the project contains `.editorconfig`
